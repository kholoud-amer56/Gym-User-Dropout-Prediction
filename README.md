# Gym-User-Dropout-Prediction
Gym User Dropout Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict whether a gym user is likely to stop using the fitness service based on behavioral and demographic features. The model analyzes factors such as session frequency, average calories burned, days since last login, and user goals to identify at-risk users early.

## Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
- Trained Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost models
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualized results (confusion matrix, ROC curve)

## Results
XGBoost with threshold tuning achieved 72% recall on dropout users and 89% overall accuracy.

## Business Impact
- Early detection of at-risk users
- Enables targeted retention strategies
- Reduces churn and increases engagement

## How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab to explore the workflow.
